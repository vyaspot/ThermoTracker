This .NET console application simulates the behavior of temperature sensors within a data center environment. A realistic model of sensor operations is provided through data generation, validation, storage, and anomaly detection, making it useful for learning, testing, or demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Sensor Initialization**: Configurable sensors via YAML files
- **Data Simulation**: Realistic temperature generation with noise
- **Fault Injection**: Simulates cooling failures, spikes, and complete sensor failures
- **Data Validation**: Validates readings against configured ranges
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical anomaly detection

- **Data Smoothing**: Moving average smoothing
- **Alert System**: Threshold-based alerts
